## Features

Ever wanted some futuristic energy generation that wasn't too... futuristic? I have you covered here. This pack contains:

* **Fission Reactors**: Turn Uranium into power! Attach nuclear reactors to your vessel and generate large amount of electricity. Ensure that you have enough cooling capacity with radiators for your reactors to work properly.  ﻿
* **Fission Fuel**: Store extra uranium, reprocess it and extract it from Ore with containers and reprocessors.
* **Batteries**:Store more electric charge in larger batteries
* **Capacitors**: Discharge for a burst of power! These parts can be charged up with normal generating capacity, and once activated will deliver a large amount of power to your ship's electricity banks. Very mass effic﻿ient!

## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [ModuleManager (4.2.3)](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## Optional Patches

Some extra patches are bundled that you can use to tweak your installation. To install them, drop the correct folder from the **Extras** folder into your KSP GameData Folder

* **DecayingRTGs**: Converts stock and mod RTGs to slowly lose power over time

This mod includes compatibility patches for the following mods:
* [KSP-AVC](https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KSPAddonVersionChecker): Provides version checking
* [Community Tech Tree](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CommunityTechTree): Provides an expanded, community-sourced technology tree for modders to use
